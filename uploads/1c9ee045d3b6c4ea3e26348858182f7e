Organize work in tracks
A learning Path is a set of tracks

a track is devided into superskills
a superskill is what we call a chapter

each track contains several superskills and a Lab phase
Lab phase is the final big project students spend 2 weeks then we validate with them


Skill :The core component of content; Duration : 20-60 mins

Assessments : To pass a *skill*  students must be assigned an assessment to evaulate their knowledge
 of that specific skills quizz, fill in the blanks etc .. 
Duration : 2 mins

additional resources : additional links to resources they might need

checkpoints :  A mini project that takes 3-4 hours of work solo and 1 hour correction and validation with 
everyone
Duration : Average of 1 hour

Workshop : is a meeting which people try to imporive their skills by discussing their experiences and 
applying practical
exercices and challenges
Average : 3 hours

One to one meeting : It's aiming to evaluate the aquisistion of the super Skill functionals knoweldge 
by the student

Lab Phase : it's the last project that concludes the training
Duration : two weeks for assessement and validation
Must be an idividual work.

The checkpoint is the project that concludes a super skill.




check point phase :the students shoudl submit their work within 3 to 7 days of starting the superskill
I check the chekcpoints and give them feedback (don't close the checkpoint)

each Friday the students form groups of two or three and discuss how they came up with their solutions 
for 15 mins, I help students guide them and ask them the right questions

only after this discussion and feedback all the guild corrects the checkpoint by picking a pair to present 
their work and expain it to their peers everyone discusses corrections
then I close the checkpoint on the plateform
